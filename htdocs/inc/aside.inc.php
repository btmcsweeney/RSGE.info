For now I guess I'll just put some notes in here.<br><br>
Aside from the design, this is the result of a grand total of 2 days' work. Use the input box to search for items and add them to the graph. You can remove items from the graph completely by using the remove box, or you could just hide a line by clicking on its name. I think the next thing I'm going to work on is picking the date range for the graph to display.<br><br>
<s>Anyway, please don't go telling all your friends about this just yet.</s>On second thought, tell them. Tell all of them. <3<br><br>
This is an alpha release. Once I make enough features to constitute a beta release, I'll actually put it on the domain http://rsge.info. Until then, just look forward to it.<br><br><br>
